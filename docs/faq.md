# FAQ
## I found a bug, how can I report it?
You can post an issue to: [Github Issues](https://github.com/Kami-Guru/path-of-levelling-2/issues)

Make sure to read the existing issues to confirm it hasn't already been reported.

## What features are planned?

I would like to implement:
- Actual settings menu implementation (change font, reset to default settings, etc)
- Ability to edit Act/Zone notes
- Redo layout images (they are originally from Lolcohol's Act guides, not indended to be viewed on a small part of a screen. His guides are fantastic: [Act 1](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/campaign-layout-act-1) [Act 2](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/campaign-layout-act-2) [Act 3](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/campaign-layout-act-3))
- Full support for builds, including:
    - Gem setups that automatically update based on your level
    - Passive tree screenshot hints which display when you open passive tree
    - Edit Act/Zone notes for that build specifically (i.e. add build-specific campaign hints)
